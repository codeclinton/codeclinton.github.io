<h1 class="words">Product design at GitHub</h1>
<p>Product design is easily the hardest aspect of building software today. Technology, hiring, funding, aesthetic design, and press are all minuscule in comparison. When I talk about product design I&rsquo;m referring to the process by which you decide what your product does and does not do. I happen to think we do a pretty good job of this at GitHub, and I&rsquo;d like to give you a bit of an insight into our process and hopefully shed some light on why it works so well.</p>

<p>I should warn you that I am not a &ldquo;Product Designer.&rdquo; We don&rsquo;t have titles at GitHub — we let employees pick their own.  I like to call myself <strong>~designer</strong> since I mostly focus on the look &amp; feel of our product. But then again, I spent the past weekend building an application to track &amp; distribute binaries and updating some of our reducing functions to support a newer version of MongoDB. So, yeah. I&rsquo;m ~designer. But maybe that leads me to my next point…</p>

<h2>Everyone is a product designer</h2>

<p>Every employee at GitHub is a product designer. We only hire smart people we  trust to make our product better. We don&rsquo;t have managers dictating what to work on. We don&rsquo;t require executive signoff to ship features. Executives, system administrators, developers, and designers concieve, ship, and remove features alike.</p>

<p>Having the role of &ldquo;Product Designer&rdquo; or having a CEO who says they&rsquo;re going to &ldquo;focus on product design now&rdquo; never made much sense to me. Aren&rsquo;t you hiring smart people who use your product? Don&rsquo;t you trust your employees? Doesn&rsquo;t everyone at your company want to make your product better? Doesn&rsquo;t that make everyone product designers all of the time?</p>

<p>Along these lines, my two favorite questions to ask in an interview (or to people who don&rsquo;t know they&rsquo;re interviewing) are:</p>

<ol>
<li>What would you like to see in GitHub?</li>
<li>What feature do you think we messed up / should remove?</li>
</ol>


<p>It brings out the passion in people and instantly highlights problems you might have with their decisions. Some people just don&rsquo;t have the same vision for your product as you do, and that&rsquo;s fine.</p>

<h2>Write down ideas like crazy</h2>

<p>Our internal wiki is filled with ideas. Old ideas. Bad ideas. Good ideas. Half-baked ideas. The point is that we have a place to share our crazy with each other. <a href="https://gist.github.com/ad66d382a04c063b6861">This wiki page</a> discussing compare view eventually became <a href="https://github.com/blog/712-pull-requests-2-0">Pull Requests 2.0</a> — arguably the best code review tool I&rsquo;ve ever used.</p>

<p>Most of the time when someone adds an idea it&rsquo;s nothing original. It&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;ve discussed in person, seen in another product, or maybe thought about ourselves. But that&rsquo;s really half the point — seeing someone else write down the same idea you&rsquo;ve had makes you twice as excited about the idea. As others chime in saying they&rsquo;d love to see the feature, excitement about it grows and grows. Eventually you&rsquo;ve got 4 developers hacking on something at 11:30pm because they want to see it happen so badly.</p>

<h2>Constantly experiment and iterate</h2>

<p>Right now our main repository has 65 branches. This doesn&rsquo;t count the dozen or so other repositories that collectively represent what is <a href="https://github.com">https://github.com</a> or the 139 repositories under our organization. Needless to say, there are a ton of features, anti-features and half ideas in these branches. Sometimes they&rsquo;re really pretty features that aren&rsquo;t functional and sometimes they&rsquo;re really ugly features that are completely functional.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re always sending pull requests, shipping them to staging and asking others what they think. Talking about a feature in a meeting and crafting a spec is one thing, but coding up a working prototype is way more effective. We&rsquo;re always running experimental features in production to staff only. No better way to see if a feature is going to fit than to actually use it.</p>

<p>Once a feature is out and ready for people to use there&rsquo;s about a 100% chance that someone is going to want to change some aspect of it. So we iterate — tweak, deploy, discuss in a pull request — over and over until it&rsquo;s good enough for public consumption.</p>

<p>On that note, our pull requests are generally pretty <em>epic</em>. It turns out that pull requests are perfect for experimenting with new features, discussing them with the team, and getting others to help you ship. <a href="http://assets.warpspire.com/images/product-design/pull-request.png">Check out this pull request</a> for shipping our org profiles.  (Funny anectdote: this pull request was created before we shipped pull requests 2.0 — we <em>constantly</em> use experimental features)</p>

<h2>Abandon features</h2>

<p>You can&rsquo;t run a product and pretend that every one of your ideas is perfect. You&rsquo;re going to have bad ideas, ideas that don&rsquo;t fit, and features that become abandoned. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to abandon ideas. The amount of time you spend on something is meaningless. You&rsquo;re not losing anything by throwing work away — you&rsquo;re choosing not to make your product worse.</p>

<p>The first version of <a href="http://jobs.github.com">http://jobs.github.com</a> that we built didn&rsquo;t share a single piece of functionality with what shipped on day one. It wasn&rsquo;t an iteration — we straight up threw away a few months of work because we realized it was a bad idea. We started using our creation and realized we couldn&rsquo;t figure out how to make money without pissing off our customers. So we abandoned that idea and started anew — even though we could have shipped it and started making money immediately.</p>

<p>Shipping features because you spent time or money on them is a coward&rsquo;s excuse. It takes balls to abandon features — grow some.</p>

<h2>Argue all the time</h2>

<p>We do not have a quiet workplace. We argue in bars, in Campfire and in email. New hires and CEOs alike. But it&rsquo;s not personal — it&rsquo;s about making our product better. If you&rsquo;re not forced to rationalize your product  choices, who&rsquo;s to say you&rsquo;re making good decisions?</p>

<p>Arguing with your co-workers isn&rsquo;t a bad thing. It&rsquo;s not creating a negative work environment — it&rsquo;s a tool to help you make good decisions. Being an empty cheerleader and telling everyone that their idea is great is harmful and short-sighted. Argue and make good decisions.</p>

<h2>Talk to your customers</h2>

<p>I spend a good portion of my day reading through our <a href="http://support.github.com">support site</a>, mailing lists, twitter feeds, and blog posts written about git and GitHub. Listening to your customers is supremely important — they&rsquo;re full of great ideas. They&rsquo;re also full of shockingly terrible ideas. As <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2011/03/29/ten-lessons-from-githubs-first-year.html">Tom</a> puts it:</p>

<blockquote><p>Don’t give your customers what they ask for; give them what they want.</p></blockquote>

<p>We also spend a lot of <em>physical</em> time with our customers. We have monthly meetups here in San Francisco, and you can pretty much guarantee that anyone who&rsquo;s traveling will host a meetup in whatever city they&rsquo;re in.  People can get crazy online. It&rsquo;s a lot harder to spout out that crazy when you&rsquo;re talking to someone face to face. It forces people to really think about what they&rsquo;re going to say and reminds them that there&rsquo;s a living, breathing human being behind the product.</p>

<h2>Product design is in the eye of the beholder</h2>

<p>We know that product design isn&rsquo;t just adding and removing features. It&rsquo;s how our customers perceive the features. Who cares if some analyst thinks your company is doing well if your customers don&rsquo;t?</p>

<p>Having a great blog post explaining new features is absolutely killer. It allows us to frame features in a certain light and explain our thinking. It also shows a record of shipping — and we try hard to ship and tell people about it all of the time.</p>

<p>If you redesign your entire product once every two years like Twitter does, it&rsquo;s a <em>big deal</em>. If your users don&rsquo;t like 100% of it, they&rsquo;re going to be pissed. But if you ship something every two months and they don&rsquo;t like 10% of it — their overall perception is still positive.</p>

<p>We also know that what we <em>don&rsquo;t</em> do is just as important as what we <em>are</em> doing. We don&rsquo;t publish roadmaps or promise features within a timeframe — we <a href="http://ozmm.org/posts/managing_expectations.html">under promise and over deliver</a>. And really, I think that&rsquo;s why our customers are so happy with our product design as a whole.</p>

<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t give your customers what they ask for, give them what they want. Under promise, over deliver.</strong></p>
