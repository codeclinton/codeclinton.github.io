<h1 class="words">Ego</h1>
<p>I remember the first time Bitbucket straight up stole one of my designs. The layout. The borders. The shadows. The exact information on the page!</p>

<p>I was angry.</p>

<p>This is <em>my</em> design. I was the one who put in the time. I spent the hours in a dark room with all the stuff that <em>could</em> be until I had the stuff that <em>should</em> be. I was the one who designed five wrong iterations until I got the right one. And it was good. People loved it. And these — these <em>barbarians</em> just stole it. Every last bit.</p>

<p>I was real angry. I wanted to start a scene. I wanted to get real angry, real public.</p>

<p>But my customers didn&rsquo;t care. They didn&rsquo;t even notice.</p>

<p>Because they were <em>my</em> customers. They loved it. They were happy. They got something nice to use. Customers love that shit. They eat it up. Nice to use? <em>Into it.</em></p>

<hr />

<p>Ego is such a hard thing. I struggle with it constantly. I struggle with it right now as I&rsquo;m writing this. I know at my core that when I design software, the most important thing to me is that people are pleased — that they like using my product and it makes their life a little bit better. And I know — <em>I know</em> — that has everything to do with the product, and nothing to do with me.</p>

<p>But here I am. And I want it to be about me.</p>

<p>And to be honest, that&rsquo;s still the hardest thing about designing products. <em>Design is a job.</em> If I want people to celebrate me, this isn&rsquo;t the career. My job is to make good shit that people like. And there isn&rsquo;t room for me in that equation.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s the product.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s the team.</p>

<p>But more than anything else — there&rsquo;s the customers.</p>

<p>Those people who make products real. Real life humans with emotions and opinions and happiness and sadness and money. Money that puts food on my table.</p>

<p>So you know, I have to remind myself: it&rsquo;s about them. It&rsquo;s about the customers. It&rsquo;s not about me.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" lang="en"><p>Product: compassion strong enough to ignore your selfish desires in order to build something for someone else.</p>&mdash; Kyle Neath (@kneath) <a href="https://twitter.com/kneath/status/425100294809059328">January 20, 2014</a></blockquote>

<p>Tomorrow — I&rsquo;ll be a customer. And then it can be about me.</p>

<hr />

<p>What about Bitbucket&rsquo;s customers? They liked it too. It made their day a little bit better.</p>

<p>Because of me. I made even more people happy.</p>

<p>But I didn&rsquo;t get to own that. You know? That&rsquo;s still hard. But in the long run it&rsquo;s a good thing. Because it doesn&rsquo;t matter if I owned it or not. I made something good that people enjoyed. Even more people than usual.</p>

<p>The team that stole my layout? They&rsquo;re probably good people too. They were thinking about their customers. Not Kyle Neath.</p>

<p>And then someone else redesigned the page. And made it even better.</p>

<p>All without me.</p>
