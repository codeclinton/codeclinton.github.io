<p>As I sit in my apartment right now, I&rsquo;m assuming what is effectively the entirety of the technology industry is managing the task rabbits packing their art cars, private chefs, fusion reactors, and backup iPads into their U-Hauls for the long journey to the Black Rock Desert. Oh — and drugs — lots, and lots of drugs. I mean, do you even <em>know</em> of Steve Jobs?</p>

<p>In the industry, we have this phrase — <em>ship early, ship often</em> — it&rsquo;s a great little hack we&rsquo;ve developed to avoid taking any real responsibility for our decisions. If we&rsquo;re doing it fast, we&rsquo;re trying to fuck up. Get it? We&rsquo;re <em>trying</em> to do a bad job. No? Well, normal people won&rsquo;t ever understand tech, and like I said the important part is drugs. Quite frankly, that DMT isn&rsquo;t going to trip itself, and it&rsquo;s important to make sure you&rsquo;re not rolling up to the desert with a bag of duds. <em>Ship early, ship often.</em></p>

<hr />

<p>So anyways, I got this call from my product manager at 8pm last night, and all I can hear is some dog screaming in the background and what sounds like The Sopranos playing on an iPad. This shit is a little too deep for me right now, so I hang up and get back to work. But the dude won&rsquo;t stop, and somehow he&rsquo;s rigged his phone to send a picture of this goat to me every 15 seconds.</p>

<p>Which is why I&rsquo;m pretty fucking surprised that somehow <em>I&rsquo;m in a goddamn Google Hangout with him at 3am on a Tuesday night</em>. He&rsquo;s sitting there, and I swear the fucker is <em>glowing</em> — but it&rsquo;s not like a supernatural light — I think he painted himself in glow in the dark paint or something because it just looks really bad and it&rsquo;s all over his dog too (who does <em>not</em> seem very chill about this whole situation). While I&rsquo;m sitting here watching this performance art, I start to wonder if this shit really is for me, and suddenly all I hear is screaming.</p>

<p>Dude is <em>not</em> happy. Guess he&rsquo;s angry that I sorta zoned out after the first twenty minutes and fired up another LoL match. Dude just keeps getting louder and louder, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all just a comment. A COMMENT. I SEE IT NOW. EVERYTHING IS A COMMENT.&rdquo; We don&rsquo;t even have comments on our site, what the fuck dude? Right around the time he pulls out a box of matches, I decide this shit is <em>not</em> for me and close my laptop. Most people just don&rsquo;t get how hard this job is. <em>Fuck</em>, dude.</p>

<p>This whole thing kinda fucked me up, so I took a few Ambien to knock me out. Apparently, product manager dude did not.</p>

<blockquote><p>From: Dude<br/>
To: All<br/>
Cc: Kyle<br/>
Subject: Important All-Hands Meeting</p>

<p>Fellow Employioneers,</p>

<p>I have some news. Kyle and I have figured it out. 3pm at the food trucks. You won&rsquo;t want to miss this.</p></blockquote>

<p>Cool. Except I have no idea what we&rsquo;ve figured out at all. All I can remember is something about comments. Suuuuuper unclear. So when we get to the food trucks, he just walks up and give me the biggest bear hug ever (and I think he smells like burned plastic?). No idea how, but I am <em>definitely</em> on his good side. This isn&rsquo;t going to go like last month&rsquo;s all-hands when we turned the site blue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Comments.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s all he says. He just sits down, smiles at me, and snaps a piece of pork belly off his truffle fries. I&rsquo;m so nervous I go through eight eel tacos and some BBQ&rsquo;d snow leopard just so I don&rsquo;t have to say anything. Meanwhile, dude just grins at me the whole meal. Real uncomfortable. We all start walking back to the office, and I&rsquo;m pretty sure cute-co-worker-in-the-corner is about to puke from the anxiety. Product manager dude looks over at me and breaks what can only be described as the most uncomfortable silence I&rsquo;ve ever experienced, &ldquo;Profound, right?&rdquo; Fuck. What do I say? Do I ask him if he&rsquo;s still high? &ldquo;Totally,&rdquo; I respond. Play it cool. Play it cool. &ldquo;Damn right!&rdquo; he exclaims and slaps my back.</p>

<p>When we get back to the office, he breaks the silence agian, &ldquo;Thank you all for coming. Kyle&rsquo;s got this — follow his lead. Let&rsquo;s see where we are by tomorrow morning.&rdquo; <em>Motherfucker!</em> I&rsquo;m freaking out, so I tell everyone I need ten minutes to pull together my thoughts. I open up my email and start furiously scanning the messages he sent me last night. Thankfully, there&rsquo;s eighteen emails labeled &lsquo;COMMENT&rsquo; so I&rsquo;m starting to think there&rsquo;s hope. The first twelve are doge pictures, but the thirteenth finally bears some fruit.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Post</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">Comment</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></div>


<p>I keep going through these emails and I&rsquo;m starting to get it.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Photo</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">Comment</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Friend</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">Comment</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">User</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">Comment</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></div>


<p>The seventeenth email is when it finally hits me like a ton of bricks.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">CommentComment</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">Comment</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></div>


<p>Fuck. I&rsquo;ve just agreed to replace everything in our site with comments. I mean, we joked about this, but <em>he cannot be real</em>. Just one polymorphic inheritable database table of comments, all pointing to each other and joining through each other.</p>

<p>Just then I realize that&rsquo;s what <em>I</em> want us to do. <em>Kyle&rsquo;s got this</em>, that&rsquo;s what he said.</p>

<hr />

<p>Well, as they say — <em>so it goes</em>. Comments, here we come baby! That eighteenth email, by the way?</p>

<blockquote><p>From: Dude<br/>
To: Kyle<br/>
Subject: COMMENT</p>

<p>But only SOMETIMES</p></blockquote>

<p>Not quite sure what to do with that one, but cute-co-worker-in-the-corner just rolled up to my desk so I&rsquo;m just gonna go with what I have for now.</p>

<hr />

<p><em>This post is full of satire and absurdity (sometimes I just like to write because it&rsquo;s fun — also that tweet series was hilarious), but I do kind of miss when Twitter was deterministic and didn&rsquo;t take psychedelic drugs to explain what the difference between a Favorite and a Retweet was. Chalk it up to another piece of software I have to explain with &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not dumb, this shit is just confusing, even to me.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><em>And shoutout to <a href="https://twitter.com/court3nay">@court3nay</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/technoweenie">@technoweenie</a> for the CommentComment joke. STI, it&rsquo;s one hell of a drug.</em></p>
