<h1 class="words">Build your business around an idea</h1>
<p>Living in San Francisco and working in tech right now is absolutely insane. Employers and recruiters battle for employees while VCs rain down millions of dollars <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/28/yuri-milner-sv-angel-offer-every-new-y-combinator-startup-150k/">without meeting founders or even knowing what kind of company they&rsquo;re building</a>. It&rsquo;s a crazy world to live in and can feel like money <em>is</em> growing on trees and the only spending limit is your imagination. If you have just a little bit of initiative, you can take any idea and start a company with absolutely zero personal risk.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s one of the biggest reasons San Francisco is so special to me. Everyone out here <em>knows</em> they can do anything. Spend a few weeks hanging out in bars and cafes asking what people do and you&rsquo;ll hear some of the most idiotic business ideas in the world. A lot of journalists use this argument to call San Francisco an echo chamber whose sole purpose is burning money. And you know, they&rsquo;re right.</p>

<p>This city does burn through money on terrible ideas. But that&rsquo;s a tradeoff for fostering a city of people who believe they can do anything. And that spawns an incredible number of amazing companies — so it doesn&rsquo;t bother me. What does bother me is the <em>lack of imagination</em> most startup founders have.</p>

<h2>Build something incredible</h2>

<p>Most founders I talk to are pretty complacent building something mediocre. They won&rsquo;t admit if you flat out ask them — but try pressing them to describe what makes their company special. Most cop out and give you an answer like:</p>

<blockquote><p>We&rsquo;re building [technology x] because [company y] hasn&rsquo;t built it and [people z] need it.</p></blockquote>

<p>Want a more concrete example? How about something like:</p>

<blockquote><p>We&rsquo;re building a cloud sync solution for iOS because Apple hasn&rsquo;t built it and almost every iOS application needs sync.</p></blockquote>

<p>There are thousands of people building products like this. They&rsquo;re filling holes. Filling holes is mediocre and boring. Dare to build something incredible – something unique, something lasting, something special.</p>

<h2>Ideas are lasting, products are not</h2>

<p>The easiest way to build something incredible is to base your business around an idea. Products are just the manifestation of the idea.</p>

<p>This is something I think about at GitHub a lot. We&rsquo;ve built an amazing product (<a href="https://github.com">github.com</a>) — but when you ask us what the <a href="https://github.com/about">company is about</a> we say:</p>

<blockquote><p>We make it easier to collaborate with others and share your projects with the universe.</p></blockquote>

<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of interesting things you <em>don&rsquo;t</em> see it that description: Git, version control, issue tracking, wikis, or website. We know that our product (a website hosting git repositories with built-in issue tracking &amp; wikis) is great — but if it doesn&rsquo;t serve a higher purpose, it would be mediocre. So we focus on the idea.</p>

<p>That means looking at version control, wikis, and issue tracking as tools for collaboration. It means that as important as it is for our website to be easy to use — it&rsquo;s equally important for Git to be easy to use. Or to create tools that let people use Git without even knowing they&rsquo;re using Git.</p>

<p>If I look into the future, I know that the idea of collaboration is lasting — but Git? That&rsquo;s a hard bet to make. I know that if we focus our business on collaboration we can build something lasting. If we focus our business on being a Git host we&rsquo;re doomed.</p>

<h2>Ideas are sexy</h2>

<p>One of the more awesome things about building your business around an idea is how easy it is to pitch to others. Ideas are sexy and draw people in — they invite passion and commitment. And pitching people is all about displaying passion and commitment. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;re pitching for VC funding, trying to land a new customer, or interviewing a prospective employee — having a good pitch is critical to any successful business.</p>

<p>People want to be part of ideas. Being part of a company who builds a successful product is cool… but being part of an idea is a lot more attractive. If you can build a business where both your employees and your customers think they&rsquo;re part of an idea, you&rsquo;ve created something special.</p>

<h2>Evolving ideas from products</h2>

<p>The trouble is that founding a company around an idea doesn&rsquo;t actually work. Apple <del>Computer</del> is a great example. They take bleeding edge technology, marry it with exceptional design, and sell it at a premium price. But the company wasn&rsquo;t always like that. It was founded around a product — the personal computer. Yet in 2011, Apple&rsquo;s biggest business is mobile phones.</p>

<p>You have to ask… how did a company founded around building personal computers come to generate most of its revenue from mobile phones? They <em>evolved</em>. They found their strengths (design, technology), and evolved the company around those values. This manifested itself into new products — the iPod, iPhone, iPad, TV, MobileMe, Airport Expresses, Cinema Displays, etc. Some successes. Some failures.</p>

<p>The core component of all these products is that they are manifestations of an idea. When the iPod took off in popularity, Apple didn&rsquo;t rearrange the company around portable music devices. They kept focusing on building exceptionally designed hi-tech gadgets with bleeding edge technology.</p>

<p>So it&rsquo;s okay to focus on a product at first. But as soon as you find your strengths as a company, abstract it out into an idea and focus on that. Do that and you won&rsquo;t have your entire business invalidated by a feature that Facebook or Apple rolled out at their last keynote. Because ideas will last, products won&rsquo;t.</p>
