<h1 class="words">Rethinking Warpspire</h1>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s always a good idea to take a step back and ask yourself why you&rsquo;re doing something.  So right now I&rsquo;m taking a step back to rethink Warpspire.</p>

<h2>Getting rid of cruft</h2>

<p>The other day I followed a link to a blog post on Mint. I was presented with this screen:</p>

<div class="figure"><img src="http://assets.warpspire.com/images/rethinking/mint_screen.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Mint blog post" /></div>


<p>I hate what most designers have done to the web. You&rsquo;d think people would be taking cues from things like <a href="http://lab.arc90.com/experiments/readability/">Readability</a> and Safari Reader, but they&rsquo;re not. People are throwing more and more crap onto each page and making things harder and harder to read.</p>

<p>Anyways, it got me to thinking about sites that I continue to enjoy reading in the browser. One site that immediately came to mind is <a href="http://daringfireball.net">Daring Fireball</a>. The format and presentation has lasted for years without feeling tired or hard to read. So it should come as no suprise that this new layout mirrors DF in a great number of ways. (Alas, my logo features the same unicode character as DF â€” something which has now turned from a funny coincidence to a long boring story. I hate logos.)</p>

<div class="figure"><img src="http://assets.warpspire.com/images/rethinking/warpspire_screen.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Warpspire" /></div>


<p>This new layout is the simplest layout I&rsquo;ve ever had on one of my sites. The goal was to create a focused place for my ideas.</p>

<h2>Abandoning old baggage</h2>

<p>There was a lot of crap on Warpspire. WordPress tells me the first post was published August 15, 2004. <strong>That&rsquo;s six years ago.</strong>  To say that the web is a different place now is an understatement. I remember debugging that initial site on IE5 <em>for Mac</em>.  Six years ago, I was in my 2nd year of studying Civil Engineering at Cal Poly. I had no concept of the value of the web or how important it would be come.  I was also twenty years old, angsty and wrong about many things.</p>

<p><strong><em>So I deleted most of my posts.</em></strong></p>

<p>What&rsquo;s left? The most popular posts (traffic wise) along with a couple of ones that I particularly enjoyed and still felt relevant.  I&rsquo;ve also edited them all, and rewritten some.</p>

<p>Almost certainly a bad idea for my traffic, but probably a good idea for my readership. And I&rsquo;ll value readers over pageviews any day.</p>

<h2>On the subject of comments</h2>

<p>The thing about comments is that commentors tend to be a bunch of crazies wandering the internet like it&rsquo;s a zombie apocolypse. It&rsquo;s a striking contrast to the rational human beings whom I have sensible arguments with here in the meatspace.</p>

<p>The thing is, I&rsquo;ve met some of the smartest people on the planet through my site and I don&rsquo;t want to lose that. So here&rsquo;s the deal: you send me email, and I send you one back.  If I think others might be interested in what you have to say, I&rsquo;ll post it here on Warpspire.</p>

<p>A comment should mean something to you and it should mean something to me. Typical blog comments just stopped meaning anything to me a long time ago and that sucks. So I&rsquo;m hoping this is a move toward fixing that.</p>
