<h1 class="words">Designing GitHub for Mac</h1>
<p>A few days ago we lifted the curtains on a project I&rsquo;ve been deep into for a long time now: <a href="http://mac.github.com">GitHub for Mac</a>. This is the first OS X app I&rsquo;ve designed and thought it might be interesting to share some of the process and things I learned throughout development.</p>

<h2>Why should we build  it?</h2>

<p>For a long time I assumed OS X developers would see the immense market for an awesome Git application. Unfortunately for everyone involved, every OS X application that&rsquo;s showed up over the years gave up and tried to turn CLI commands into buttons.</p>

<div class="figure">
  <img src="http://assets.warpspire.com/images/githubmac/tower.png" alt="Screenshot of Git Tower" />
</div>


<p>Clients claiming to be &ldquo;simple&rdquo; choose to redefine &ldquo;simple&rdquo; as fewer supported Git commands rather than simplifying the interaction with Git.</p>

<p>It blows my mind that no one tried to do anything special. Git (and its  DVCS cousins like Mercurial &amp; Bazaar) provide an amazing platform to build next generation clients — and it&rsquo;s like the entire OS X ecosystem left their imagination at home.</p>

<p>Eventually, I (well, many of us) decided that better native clients (OSX, Windows, Linux, Eclipse, Visual Studio, etc) was the best way to grow GitHub. And since we all use Macs — we should start off with an OS X application. Build what you know/use, expand from there.</p>

<h2>What are we building?</h2>

<p>Personally, I had some big goals:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Death of the SSH key. People should be able to connect to GitHub with their GitHub username and password.</p></li>
<li><p>Make it obvious that there <em>is</em> a distinction between remote and local. Make it clear what commits need to be pushed before others can see them.</p></li>
<li><p>Simplify the <code>git fetch, pull (--rebase), push</code> interaction. Synchronize — don&rsquo;t make the user figure out what they need to do to get their local commits remote and remote commits local.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix the local/remote branching problem. Get rid of this tracking idea — interact with local or remote branches as if they were no distinction between the two.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to replace the command line. <strong>I wanted to build an awesome version control client.</strong> As it happens, Git is the perfect backend to do that — and GitHub is the perfect central server to collaborate.</p>

<h2>Sketches &amp; early ideas</h2>

<p>The first thing we did was to start populating an internal wiki full of ideas. Lots of words, lots of sketches.</p>

<div class="figure">

</div>


<h2>Let&rsquo;s get some designers on this</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;d been using OS X for years, but I didn&rsquo;t feel comfortable designing a native app. My previous attempts at OS X design weren&rsquo;t too fantastic…</p>

<div class="figure">
  <a href="http://assets.warpspire.com/images/githubmac/storia-full.png"><img src="http://assets.warpspire.com/images/githubmac/storia.png" alt="An abandoned design direction." /></a>
</div>


<p>In the end, we hired <a href="http://eddit.com/">Eddie Wilson</a> to come up with some wireframes and some comps while <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/joericioppo">Joe</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/joshaber">Josh</a> cranked away at the Cocoa backend. His first comps were a great start, and influenced the end product tremendously.</p>

<div class="figure">
  <a href="http://assets.warpspire.com/images/githubmac/eddit1-full.png"><img src="http://assets.warpspire.com/images/githubmac/eddit1.png" alt="Eddie's mockup" /></a>
</div>




<div class="figure">
  <a href="http://assets.warpspire.com/images/githubmac/eddit2-full.png"><img src="http://assets.warpspire.com/images/githubmac/eddit2.png" alt="Eddie's mockup" /></a>
</div>


<p>Unfortunately right about this time is when we learned how much we suck at working with contractors. We&rsquo;re extremely opinionated, really bad at expressing our opinions, and change our minds all the time. We asked Eddie to hold off while we re-grouped and figured out what we wanted from the app.</p>

<p>We sat down and had a lot of discussions about how we wanted this thing to work. <a href="http://www.brandonwalkin.com/blog/">Brandon Walkin</a> helped out quite a bit, and even sketched up some wireframes &amp; notes for us.</p>

<p>Eventually we figured out what we wanted to design — but now we didn&rsquo;t have anyone to design it. Eddie had since taken up other work and pretty much every Cocoa designer on the planet was inundated with work.</p>

<p>In the end, I decided that GitHub for Mac was <em>the thing</em> I wanted out of GitHub, and if I wanted it to happen I&rsquo;d have to take the design reins. I picked up Eddie&rsquo;s comps and ran with it.</p>

<h2>A slow process</h2>

<p>I tried my best to combine Eddie&rsquo;s original comps with our internal feedback and match it up with a modern OS X look &amp; feel. All in all I created 45 comps for 1.0 — each with about 5-10 unique states (with layer groups).</p>

<div class="figure">
  <a href="http://assets.warpspire.com/images/githubmac/comps-full.png"><img src="http://assets.warpspire.com/images/githubmac/comps.png" alt="All my mockups" /></a>
</div>


<p>After the first round of comps, I started writing down how I imagined everything to work.</p>

<div class="figure">
  <a href="http://share.kyleneath.com/secrets/08bce2/"><img src="http://assets.warpspire.com/images/githubmac/styleguide.png" alt="The styleguide" /></a>
</div>


<p>My plan was to fully flesh out this styleguide — but as it happened, <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/joshaber">Josh</a> was able to implement my designs faster than I could explain them. Still, I think it was a good exercise to explain my thinking for the designs — if anything for my own personal benefit.</p>

<h2>The aesthetic</h2>

<p>Learning the OS X aesthetic wasn&rsquo;t easy. And it probably didn&rsquo;t help that I started to get serious about OS X design about the same time Lion screenshots started showing up. Like it or not, OS X app design is changing in drastic ways right now.</p>

<div class="figure">

</div>


<p>Scrollbars are a thing of the past. Titlebars full of clickable areas. Buttons shedding themselves of borders. Custom graphics / buttons for every app. And Helvetica everywhere!</p>

<p>I tried my best to weigh this new direction with a lot of my favorite designed apps — <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/twitter/id409789998?mt=12">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://macrabbit.com/espresso/">Espresso</a>, <a href="http://sparrowmailapp.com/">Sparrow</a>, and <a href="http://www.panic.com/transmit/">Transmit</a> to name a few.</p>

<small>Tweetie style side-tabs. No title in the window, instead a breadcrumb — always promoting a one-window experience.</small>
</div>




<div class="figure">
  <img src="http://assets.warpspire.com/images/githubmac/popover.png" alt="Popover" />
<small>We use a lot of popovers (borrowed from iOS / XCode) rather than modal windows throughout the app.</small>

<h2>Lessons learned</h2>

<p>Designing a native OS X app was definitely full of surprises. I&rsquo;ve actually done quite a bit of native development before with WPF &amp; Flex — but Cocoa is quite different.</p>

<h3>Welcome to 2004 — everything is a sliced image</h3>

<p>Remember web development in 2004? When you had to create pixel-perfect comps because every element on screen was an image? That&rsquo;s what developing for Cocoa is. Drawing in code is <em>slow</em> and <em>painful</em>. Images are easier to work with and result in more performant code.</p>

<div class="figure">
  <img src="http://assets.warpspire.com/images/githubmac/slices.png" alt="All of the slices" />
<small>Remember these days?</small>
</div>


<p>This meant my Photoshop files had to be a <em>lot</em> more fleshed out than I&rsquo;ve been accustomed to in recent years. I usually get about 80% complete in Photoshop (using tons of screenshotting &amp; layer flattening), then jump into code and tweak to completion. But with Cocoa, I ended up fleshing out that last 20% in Photoshop.</p>

<h3>Change is painful</h3>

<p>Want to move an element from the bottom of the screen to the top? A lot of times with Cocoa this involves rewriting your entire view. There is <em>no layout engine</em> for Cocoa. If you want two elements to rest side to side, you&rsquo;ll need to calculate the pixel size of the text, padding, borders, margins — then manually position the next element.</p>

<div class="figure">
  <img src="http://assets.warpspire.com/images/githubmac/interfacebuilder.png" alt="A typical xib file" />
<small>What about Interface Builder? Pretty useless. Everything is a blue box on complex projects.</small>
</div>


<p>Want to change the background color of a button? You&rsquo;re probably going to have to rewrite all of the drawing code for the button. There is no styling engine in Cocoa.</p>

<p>This sucks. And it means that change is insanely painful in code. It&rsquo;s much easier to prototype with HTML / CSS and see if the design is going to hold up.</p>

<p><a href="http://share.kyleneath.com/secrets/08bce2/changes.html">This proposed changes redesign</a> is a good example of what I mean. I spent a long time creating a &ldquo;clickable&rdquo; prototype with animations. In the end, we decided a lot of the core ideas were wrong and decided not to go down that path. Creating this HTML/CSS/JS prototype took a couple days. Doing the same in code would have taken a lot longer — and been <em>much</em> harder to throw away (due to the way project files work in Xcode, branching is not simple).</p>

<h3>Objective-C is easy, Cocoa is hard</h3>

<p>This was the first serious Cocoa project I&rsquo;ve been involved with. I had dozens of little example projects, but never pushed through to ship anything.  As I went on and talked to people about my frustrations, they inevitably came up with the same response:</p>

<blockquote><p>Why don&rsquo;t you just use MacRuby?</p></blockquote>

<p>Why? Because <strong>Objective-C is really easy.</strong> The language was never a problem. You know what was? Cocoa. Learning the differences between layer-backed views, layer-hosted views — understanding that you have to subclass <em>everything</em> — balancing delegates, weak connections, strong connections, KVC, view controllers, and notifications — understanding little intricacies like how AppKit flips <code>.xib</code>s when it load them up or how hard it is to make one word in a sentence bold. I&rsquo;m not going to lie: Cocoa (that is: AppKit, UIKit, Core Text, Core Animation, etc) is extremely difficult. The gap between simple example apps and a fully functional application is huge.</p>

<p>Projects like <a href="https://github.com/BigZaphod/Chameleon">Chameleon</a> that give you a purely layer-backed environment to work with using a modern API (UIKit) matter <em>far</em> more than the language you&rsquo;re using. This isn&rsquo;t to say MacRuby isn&rsquo;t awesome —  it just means that it doesn&rsquo;t make AppKit development any easier; you still have to learn Cocoa.</p>

<p>Along those same lines, I think that <strong>Cocoa is dying for a framework.</strong> Something that weighs on the simple defaults side rather than complex code generation side.</p>

<h3>Secrecy is overrated</h3>

<p>GitHub for Mac was in development for just under a year and there was never any leaked screenshots or blog posts. In fact, there were dozens of <a href="http://dribbble.com/shots/54738-Desktop-UI">public</a> <a href="http://dribbble.com/shots/170535-Add-Repo-Local">screenshots</a> of the <a href="http://dribbble.com/shots/141734-Stars?list=103-Operation-08bce2">app</a> on dribbble — but for the most part, people were surprised when we launched.</p>

<p>We didn&rsquo;t have beta testers sign NDAs or demand first-borns to get access to the early builds. How on earth did we keep something under wraps for so long?</p>

<p>We asked people politely not to share it with the world. It&rsquo;s really not that hard. Don&rsquo;t send betas to douchebags. Politely ask people not to blog about it. Done.</p>

<h2>Here&rsquo;s to a bright future</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m hoping that GitHub for Mac (and supporting projects, like <a href="https://github.com/libgit2">libgit2</a>) spurs a new round of creativity in source control clients. I&rsquo;ve already seen some progress — like <a href="https://github.com/kennethreitz/legit">legit</a> — but I&rsquo;m hoping to see a new generation of source control clients in the future. Git is immensely powerful, and it&rsquo;s up to us to leverage that power into something awesome.</p>
