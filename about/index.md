# Hello World

Hi, my name is **Chip Eyler** and I built _Freqn.com_ to collect my thoughts about programming and random topics.

My experience has been focused on web development. It's something that I get to do for fun and for a living.

## Building

My areas of interest, expertise & continued growth are:

* Ruby
* Ruby on Rails
* Test Driven Development
* Responsive Front End Web Development
* JavaScript (JS, jQuery & Angular)
* API Integration
* Side projects
* People

Visit [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chipeyler) for an overview of my skill set.

## Collaboration

Technology changes daily. It's vital that we as developers, engineers, designers, marketers & business people study the latest trends & technologies. It's also imperative that we support each other. Enough businesses erode and lose relevance due to an "us versus them" mentality festering within. I believe that such thinking is cancerous to any organization & must be eradicated.

## Contributions

Aside from side projects, I invest in people. In early 2014 I kickstarted a local group to help others in my area learn to code. Aside from learning and demonstrating various projects, we're gradually repositioning our focus to help the local business community and non-profits leverage emerging hardware & software technology for growth.

Additional groups where I contribute or participate:

* CincyRB
* Reach Clinton County
* Side Project Cincy
* Columbus RB
